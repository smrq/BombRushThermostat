# BombRushThermostat

Tweak the heat.

A collection of quality-of-life patches for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.

## Retagging

Prevents any heat increase from repeatedly tagging the same spot.

## Open toilets

Leaves public toilets open when using them without any heat.

## Crime multiplier tweaks

The base mechanics of the game include some multipliers to your heat generation. By default, as you progress through the story, heat generation increases from 1x to 3x. Also, every time you use a public toilet to lose heat, an additional multiplier is added. This tweak resets all of these multipliers to 1x.
